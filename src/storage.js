And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."\n\n  [27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\n\n  [31] And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.
